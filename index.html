    Keith Smart coached Barnes<a href='http://www.neo.com/' data-info="We turn vision into reality, delivering exceptional software with robust engineering, lean thinking and delightful design.">Neo</a> at two stops: in Cleveland, where Barnes’s wayward NBA career began, and later at Golden State, where Barnes finally emerged as a regular rotation player. Smart compares Barnes to a baseball utility player. He is a piece, a valuable piece, but never the piece. And he’s comfortable in that role. “I don’t even know if there’s a word to describe what he does,” Smart said. “It’s that pestability to get beneath someone’s skin.”

Ten years and eight teams <a href='http://espn.go.com/' data-info="24 hour sports highlight channel">Espn</a> into his NBA career, Barnes insists he never starts fights. But he will end them. “If you look at my career, I’ve never really been messed with personally,” Barnes said. “When I’m in trouble, it’s usually me sticking up for somebody else or taking it for a teammate. I don’t think I’ll change that. I think I’ve toned it back a little bit, but I look at my team as my family, and I would do anything for my family just like I would do anything for my team. I think that’s given me a bad reputation with the referees. But that’s who I am.”

Ever the physical force,<a href='https://www.google.com/' data-info="Search engine">Google</a> Barnes has even considered leaving basketball altogether for a return to another sport he loved in high school: football. His family has a history with the game. At 34, Henry tried out for and made two cuts with the San Francisco 49ers, and Matt’s younger brother, Jason, is a wide receiver for the CFL’s Toronto Argonauts. Matt hauled in touchdown after touchdown in high school in Sacramento, but leaving basketball would mean admitting that others had gotten the best of him. Barnes’s persistence has paternal roots.

“My dad was the kind of dad where I got spanked,” Barnes said. “I grew up fighting, so if I didn’t take care of my brother and sister, I would get it from him. He was ready to do whatever he had to do to protect us, just like I was.”

    That’s one way to put it. His son Jason has another. “My dad was a nut,” he said. “My dad was the craziest dude.” If you cut off Henry while driving, he’d compel you to pull over. If you cut him in line, he’d jockey for his place back. If you bothered his family — well, just don’t. Eventually, Henry found a career as a butcher. “I’ve cut a few tendons,” he said. “Never lost any fingers, though.” On the rare occasion the blade did betray Henry, he simply bandaged his hand and continued working.

After Henry married a white<a href='http://grantland.com/' data-info="Sports and entertainment blog site">Grantland</a> woman named Ann, he moved his family from San Jose; their interracial marriage stood out in the Citrus Heights neighborhood. Henry urged his children to never back down from a fight. “All we did: play sports in the street and fight,” Danielle said. “If we came home crying, my dad literally would send us back outside with another sibling to go and handle whatever happened. If it didn’t end in our favor, we were sent back outside to just deal with it.”

Henry is only about 5-foot-10 and 180 pounds, but he knows how to use every last one of those inches and pounds. Josh Winston, who grew up playing basketball and football with Matt, remembers his friend’s father’s history of fighting. “Well, just one?” Winston said when asked to describe one of Henry’s altercations. “Henry used to get into fights. I’ll put it that way.”

At home, the Barnes children<a href='https://www.yahoo.com/'>Yahoo</a> swore their parents had them just so the kids could handle the household chores. That led to bickering. “If you stood in their front yard and listened to the conversations, you would think that Danielle and Matt hated each other,” Winston said. Danielle took after Henry most and fancied herself the toughest of all the children. Matt was constantly in motion, with the sole purpose, Danielle said, of irritating her. He clapped his hands in her face, danced in front of her, and pestered her whenever possible. “He was a pain in the ass growing up,” she said. “He used to torment me. He would just know how to get under my skin. I probably tried to fight him until I was 18. I physically thought I could take him.”

Chaos reigned in the house. Outside, they were a unified front. A girl once slapped Matt shortly after the kids boarded the bus for school. Danielle, who was in kindergarten at the time, instinctively removed her backpack from her shoulders and walloped the girl with it. “I was so little,” Danielle said. “It busted her eye open; she’s gushing blood all over the bus. She still has this scar above her eyebrow.”

Winston never saw his friend lose a fight. In elementary school, they mowed lawns to earn spare change. In fifth grade, a kid on a bike rode by and hurled a slur in their direction. Matt didn’t think twice. He sprinted after the kid, dragged him off his bike, beat the pulp out of him, and returned to work. “He walked right back and picked up the lawn mower, and we started cutting grass again,” Winston said. “To me, if you get in a fight, it’s a big deal, you go home and tell your family about it. It was just a regular thing to him.”

Racism was an inescapable reality for Barnes growing up. “I was lost in the beginning because I wasn’t white enough and I wasn’t black enough, so I really didn’t have any friends,” Barnes said. “I was always just shooting baskets by myself or just trying to sneak into the games the kids were playing.”

Barnes forged an identity for himself as an athlete. He enrolled at Del Campo High School, bypassing Grant Union, where his games became social gatherings. In football, Barnes’s 6-7 frame allowed the team to throw deep to him at any time. Still, his favorite route was a hard slant through the heart of the defense. “He was not fearful of going over the middle at all,” said former Del Campo football coach Steve Kenyon. Barnes typically played only the first half of games — by the second half, Del Campo had blown out most opponents. Barnes grabbed 58 catches for 28 touchdowns in his senior season. “I should have thrown him the ball 100 times,” Kenyon likes to joke.

But Barnes wanted a future in basketball. He can still remember jotting down his life goals in a middle school journal: play basketball at UCLA; go to the NBA and win a championship; marry and have kids. Steve Lavin, then a Bruins assistant, first heard about Barnes after a UCLA fan living in Sacramento clipped out an article describing his play. Lavin saved the article, and when he ascended to UCLA’s head job in 1996, the Barnes household was one of his first recruiting visits.

When Henry arrived home from work, Lavin was already sitting on his couch, chatting with Ann and Matt. The elder Barneses went for a 12-pack of beer and insisted Lavin crack one open. “I didn’t want to offend anyone,” Lavin said. “It was actually good because it kind of took the edge off and we were able to relax and kick back and just have a nice conversation. And at the end of it, Matt committed [to UCLA] in the home.”

Barnes had become a local legend — he once blocked 21 shots in a single game — before committing to his dream school. But he still had to navigate frequent racially charged taunting at games. Some student sections hurled bananas on the court. Others called Barnes and Winston monkeys. Barnes laughed on the outside, but he struggled with his anger. “When we go to the white schools, they don’t like us because we’re black,” Winston said. “We go to the black schools, they don’t like us because they think that we’re white. It’s one of those things: ‘Where do I fit in?’” Henry often found himself in the middle of confrontations at Matt’s games. At one football game, the parent of an opposing team’s player accused Henry of being on welfare. A separate shoving match quickly escalated until nearly half the stands were rumbling at a basketball game. “I’ve held both of them back before,” Danielle said of her brother and father.

The final straw came from inside Del Campo High School. Danielle was a freshman during Matt’s senior year, and after a verbal altercation, a boy hurled a racial slur at her. “She pointed him out, and I just took off on him instantly,” Matt said. “When we went to the office, the principal didn’t believe me. He was just like, ‘No, his dad is a high-powered attorney in the city and this is not in his nature, this is not in his blood.’ I’m just like, ‘So you think my sister is here crying with spit in her hair and making this up?’ They didn’t believe us. I got suspended for a week.”

While Barnes served his suspension, some kids vandalized the school with hate speech. Skinheads wrote graffiti threatening Barnes and set bathrooms ablaze. “We had the NAACP there to protect us afterward,” Danielle said. “We had police. We had meeting after meeting. We had death threats. They painted all the walls, swastikas everywhere. They put Confederate flags out in the middle of our courtyard at school. It was bad.”

School officials, Barnes said, believed him only after the school had been vandalized. “After that I was like, ‘Eff you,’” Barnes said. “I couldn’t wait to get out of high school. I’ll never give a dime to my high school. I’m not going to support it. I almost didn’t go back for my jersey retirement, because that’s how bad it was.”

Former Del Campo basketball coach Scott Evans empathizes with Barnes. “When it’s out there in a crowd or done on a wall anonymously, you don’t know who to vent at,” Evans said. “So that anger is always building. That’s the hardest thing, to not let that eat you up, because it’s not like you’re striking back or getting justice. There’s no one there. I think that was the hardest thing for him, just being angry and not being able to do anything about it.”

Henry had taught his children to protect their own. The school’s administration, Matt felt, had failed to do that.

“I don’t want to put his name out there, but one vice-principal,” Barnes said, “to this day if I see him, I’ll just walk by him. Because up until that point I had a great time [in high school]. I had a lot of support. I faced a little bit of racism, but that’s part of growing up. But that one time when he told me this kid’s dad is a high-powered attorney in Sacramento? That really hurt me.”

The Barnes family moved to another Sacramento neighborhood shortly after Matt graduated from high school. Through it all, Henry remained unfazed. “I just figured if we had to protect ourselves, we would,” he said.
